# decompose/__init__.py
"""
Decomposer registry for Map-Assistant.

A 'decomposer' is a function that takes a QueryAnalysis and returns a
Decomposition (an ordered list of PlanSteps to execute for that feature).

Usage in a per-feature module (e.g., decompose/itinerary.py):

    from decompose import register
    from core.types import Feature, QueryAnalysis, Decomposition, PlanStep

    @register(Feature.ITINERARY_PLANNER)
    def build(a: QueryAnalysis) -> Decomposition:
        return Decomposition(
            steps=[
                PlanStep("NL_EXTRACT_ITINERARY_PARAMS", {"text": a.raw}, source="llm"),
                # ...more steps...
            ],
            notes="Build day-wise itinerary"
        )

QueryManager calls get_decomposer(feature) to retrieve the registered function.
